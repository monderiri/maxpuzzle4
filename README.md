IMPORTANT NOTES: 

1. Please save the video files AND opmsggates (an abstraction) into the same folder at the same level, as the main Patcher to facilitate smooth running

2. schi8.mp4 is too large to be uploaded onto GitHub, it can be downloaded as part of a Zip file on Gdrive: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ck5af1KMEM-cyjvATtrAVsyRfT_p5EZx/view?usp=sharing
